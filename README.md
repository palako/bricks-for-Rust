# bricks-for-Rust
A clone of the Bricks classic arcade written by following the Pong tutorial for Tetra

I'm writting this simple game in Rust to get familiarity with the language, libraries, project organisation, ...

The library used is Tetra, https://tetra.seventeencups.net/. 

It comes with a great tutorial (https://tetra.seventeencups.net/tutorial/) to create a game of Pong, and all I'm doing is minor modifications to play it vertically converting it into a game of Bricks.
